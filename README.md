🛠️ Diyma — The Do-It-Yourself Project Management App
Overview

Diyma is a web-based, intuitive project management application built for homeowners and DIY enthusiasts who want to plan, organize, and execute home projects with ease.

With Diyma, users can create an account to manage every aspect of their projects — from defining titles, descriptions, timeframes, and budgets to listing required materials. The platform streamlines project planning and tracking, helping users stay organized, manage resources efficiently, and bring their ideas to life with confidence.

Our mission is simple: make managing home projects easy and enjoyable, so users can focus on building their dream spaces exactly as they envision them.
